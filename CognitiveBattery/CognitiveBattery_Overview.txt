Cognitive Battery - Overview
----------------------------

Author: Michael Gravina  
Revision: 171003  


# Purpose

This protocol contains procedures for setting up and using the overarching features of the
Cognitive Battery. Instructions for the component tasks are handled in their own protocols.


# Terminology

 - The Cognitive Battery (or CogBat) is a set of computerized tasks for the Android operating
system, running on the [SMILE experiment-writing library for Python][1]. Currently, the CogBat
contains the following tasks:  
    - [**Flanker**][2]
    - [**Moving Dot**][3]
    - [**Continuous Recognition**][4]


# Assignment of responsibilities

A principal operator should be assigned for each block of experiments in order to set up the app,
administer the tasks, and retrieve the data.

Operator(s):  

Name______________________________ Init______   Name______________________________ Init______  



# Required credentials/training

No special qualifications required.


# Required equipment and supplies

 - Android phone or tablet
 - USB transfer cable appropriate to the tablet
 - Cognitive Battery .apk installer file:
     - [For general use][5]
     - [For Cognitive Crew][6]
 - [Continuous Recognition image set][7]


# Methods and procedures


## Installation

Download the .apk installer file and the CogBat image set to your computer. Unzip the
image set. Using the USB transfer cable to connect the Android device to your
computer, and transfer the .apk file and the "smile_images" folder from the
image set to the device. 

Operator_________ Date____ /____ /__________  

On the Android device, open the File Manager app and find the .apk file. Run it to install the
CogBat. You may have to create a shortcut to display the CogBat icon on the device's home screen.  

Operator_________ Date____ /____ /__________  

Put the smile_images folder into the same folder where the SMILE folder is located
(this should be the highest-level folder on the device, often called "Internal storage").  

Operator_________ Date____ /____ /__________  


## Running the CogBat

Press the CogBat icon. A splash screen showing a brain will appear for a few seconds while the
CogBat loads. Depending on the version, this may take a long time, so be patient!  

Depending on the version, you may be presented with a subject-entry screen. A field titled
"Subject" will allow you to
enter the subject ID. There will also be a "Settings" button which allows for finer control,
including the ability to lock the subject ID so that it will automatically appear every time
the CogBat is run.  

Depending on the version, the tasks may begin immediately, or you may be presented with a screen
allowing you to choose a task to begin.  

Administrator_________ Date____ /____ /__________ Time________________  


## Data retrieval

Use the USB transfer cable to connect the Android device to your computer. Open the folder on
the device named *SMILE/data/Cognitive Battery/data/*. Within this folder you will see data
folders by subject. (If no subject ID was specified when the CogBat was run, the folder will be
named "test000".) Within the subject folders, data will be stored in subfolders, one for each
time the CogBat was run.  

**Important:** When retrieving data, be aware that folder names are only guaranteed to be unique
*within* a given device. If you are collecting data from multiple devices, there may be naming
conflicts. You should take care to sort them into unique folders on the destination computer,
and from there, curate them to ensure that no folders are inadvertently combined or overwritten.  

Operator_________ Date____ /____ /__________  


# Plan for electronic archiving

Data should be stored on a secure, password-protected computer with periodic backups.
Data should be grouped by subject folder, and within subject folders session folders should
be aggregated across all functionally identical devices and curated as necessary to ensure
that no sessions are lost and each session is identifiable by date and time.
