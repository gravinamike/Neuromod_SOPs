### List why current approaches fail

Cognitive assessments such as these simply aggregate performance
scores from a variety of tasks. The weighting of these scores in the final
metric is necessarily arbitrary, and many measurements which aren't
directly relevant to the chosen outcome but may still contain valuable
information about the processes which led to it, are neglected or underutilized.
This approach of considering only the final outputs of behaviors, while
treating the cognitive processes that *produce* those behaviors as black boxes,
could be labeled comparatively "shallow". While such assessments are capabile of providing an
objective bar for whether performance varies on some narrowly
defined metric, they are of very limited use in determining *why*
performance varies. They are also poorly
generalizable; by collapsing all aspects of a task into a single feature, they
make those aspects into invariable preconditions for future measurements and
negate the assessment's value for even slight variations on the task.


## Computational models offer a better alternative

In comparison, mechanistic computational models of cognitive processes, with 
cognitive tasks designed to dovetail with those models, offer alternatives
to traditional assessments which are both explanatory and generalizable.

A computational model doesn't merely describe results with a simple behavioral
measure or even statistical summaries on such measures. Instead, it posits
specific processes which might underlie the behavioral output and recreates these
processes mathematically or *in silico*, simulating performance based on the
same kind of input as the real subjects. If the performance of the simulation
matches that of the actual subjects, the model is taken to have
plausible explanatory value.


The advantages are threefold.

First, model-based methods aren't merely descriptive, they are predictive.
By re-implementing the very processes which they hope to explain,
computational models allow for extrapolation beyond the actual data collected during an
experiment to prediction of how a subject would behave in response to entirely new
conditions, based on the values of cognitive parameters extracted from the
model and the actual stimuli.


Second, model-based-methods are capable of increased accuracy as they can take
much better advantage of the full spectrum of data types available from
an experiment.
a model is capable of producing predictions not only on a single performance
measure but on multiple data types from each trial which may or may not 
have any direct bearing on "performance" of focal interest. For example,
in a memory task, the most obvious definition of "performance" is the overall
proportion of correct responses,
but other associated data types can readily be aquired from the same set of trials, such as
response times, confidence ratings, brain sensing or eye-tracking data, etc.
This additional information would either go to waste or be integrated in some
arbitrary manner, such as a weighted sum of factors, in non-model-based
assessments. With a model, in contrast, each of these sources of data can
potentially be predicted alongside the focal measure, and the predictions
can be checked against reality in order to hone the accuracy of the model through
parameter adjustment.

Third, model-based-methods are more generalizable and extensible than alternative methods.
Because they offer a set of explicit internal parameters which are open to
manipulation, rather than a hidden set of assumptions which must be maintained to
preserve validity, models can be much more flexibly tailored to approximate new situations
simply by adjusting parameters. And in cases where the model is simply not flexible
enough to accomodate a novel situation, that lack of flexibility often readily suggests
ways to improve upon the model.






Analytical approach is what sets us apart. Not descriptive, generative and predictive.
We implemented the processes we think underlie performance. Properly estimate uncertainty
in performance and hypothesize about parametric changes that led to differences in
performance. More accurate and more targeted interventions.


This offers additional accuracy and specificity (explain how)




## Why are we using these tasks:
Validated standards which are amenable to computational modeling. Allow us to gain info
from each trial rather than in aggregates. Cross-cognitive-domain sampling, and quick tasks.

### Overall meta-domain of "neurocapacity" is one of the focuses of our battery

### Domains: Attention. Perceptual decision. General decision. Reward learning. Working and long term memory. Inventory control processes.
