You need to use a business writing style and be fairly descriptive. You will probably end up writing at least ten pages to make your point.




Cognitive Battery - White paper

# Introduction/summary


You want to catch people right off the bat with your introduction. Pique their interest,
and then tell them what they’re going to accomplish by reading your white paper. - argue
a specific position or propose a solution to a problem - This means writing a summary
of your white paper and including an organized list of topics. 

Outline it


# Background/problems

List current approaches to cognitive assessment
List why current approaches fail

Computational models of cognitive processes, and cognitive tasks designed to dovetail
with those models, offer an alternative to traditional assessments which promises to
overcome these limitations. A computational model is not merely descriptive; it goes
beyond simple *descriptions* and statistical summaries of behavior by positing
specific processes which might underlie that behavior, then implementing similar
processes *in silico* that can be presented with the same kind of input as the real
subject. 
This offers additional accuracy and specificity (explain how)
And by re-implementing the very processes which we hope to study,
computational models allow us to go beyond the actual data collected during an
experiment and *predict* how a subject would behave in response to an entirely new
set of conditions, based on how they reacted to those in the experiment and the
assumed cognitive parameters which are extracted from the model.



Why are we using these tasks:
Validated standards which are amenable to computational modeling. Allow us to gain info
from each trial rather than in aggregates. Cross-cognitive-domain sampling, and quick tasks.

Domains: Attention. Perceptual decision. General decision. Reward learning. Working and long term memory. Inventory control processes.

Analytical approach is what sets us apart. Not descriptive, generative and predictive.
We implemented the processes we think underlie performance. Properly estimate uncertainty
in performance and hypothesize about parametric changes that led to differences in
performance. More accurate and more targeted interventions.
