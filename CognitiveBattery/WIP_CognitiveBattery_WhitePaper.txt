You need to use a business writing style and be fairly descriptive. You will probably end up writing at least ten pages to make your point.

If Per's not even going to look at this until the end, don't wreck yourself trying to come up with
citations for the sections he is expert on.

# Introduction/summary

You want to catch people right off the bat with your introduction. Pique their interest,


## Outline of what's coming

and then tell them what they’re going to accomplish by reading your white paper. - argue
a specific position or propose a solution to a problem - This means writing a summary
of your white paper and including an organized list of topics. 

-------
The tasks are well known; Analytical approach is what sets us apart. Not descriptive, generative and predictive.
We implemented the processes we think underlie performance. Properly estimate uncertainty
in performance and hypothesize about parametric changes that led to differences in
performance. More accurate and more targeted interventions.

1. What's out there now

(leads to discussion of EMA)

2. 2 calls for next set of assessments:


  a. Ecological (assessed very close to the context of interest, both in setting and time)


(However, most academic/clinical, and pretty much all commercial, offerings
simply try to detect associations between outcomes. They also 

Contemporaneously with developments in the popularity of EMA,


  b. Model-based 
     (Evaluating a whole model of the process leading to an outcome)
     (in contrast to methods that try to associate outcomes of different processes,
     without referring to the underlying factors that produce those outcomes)


Also talk about cross-domain collections of tasks and how they aren't currently well represented???? MAAAAYBE?



3. So we have sought to produce...
 - a computerized and portable task battery suitable to EMA
 - containing tasks that are already modeled or are readily amenable to computational modeling,
 - and which sample a wide variety of cognitive domains





















# Current approaches to cognitive assessment and their shortcomings


## Academic approaches

The full constellation of cognitive assessments currently in use in academic and
clinical settings is too numerous to list, but a non-exhaustive selection of common paradigms
is listed in Table 1.  

In addition to individual use for answering focal questions, cognitive
assessments are now commonly grouped into batteries shaped for a specific purpose, such as
detection of cognitive decline [1][1] [2][2], drug state [3][3], attentional disorders, affective disorders,
OCD, schizophrenia, developmental disorders, neurodegenerative disease, cerebrovascular disorders,
and traumatic brain injury [4][4].

## Commercial offerings

Recently, a new set of assessment tools has become available as part of a wave of
commercial enthusiasm for what purports to be "brain training". The flagship firm in
this movement, Lumosity, at one time marketed its computerized games as both
diagnostic tools and interventions with power to augment cognition, even in cognitive
decline, but now (after controversy and an FTC settlement [8][8]) warns users that
they are "not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease"[9][9].
Nonetheless, the company still offers its product as a platform for research [10][10].
Lumosity is representative of the broader set of commercial offerings by groups like
CogniFit [11][11], CogMed[12][12], and Posit Science Corporation [13][13]. 
Common to most of these are a reliance on vague claims about neuroplasticity [14][14],
[15][15] despite a lack of evidence of far-transfer effects beyond the specific tasks
in the batteries themselves [16][16].


## Computerization and the ethos of Ecological Momentary Assessement

However, the lack of rigor in the popular and commercial sectors should not be taken as
a general refutation of computerized cognitive assessments that are integrated into the
routine of everyday human lives (just as the spurious claims of the herbal supplement
industry do not negate the immense utility of mainstream of pharmaceutical science).
On the contrary, this burgeoning genre of games highlights increasing readiness for the
development of "in-the-field" assessments with actual scientific merit that stems from
a philosophy of rational design and solid standards of validation.

Researchers in academic and clinical settings have already begun responding to this
call. The increasing ubiquity, affordability, and power of mobile devices 
in recent years has led to the massive expansion of methods following the ethos of
Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). 
The main advantage of EMA is direct access to an individual's
behavior and subjective self-reports in the natural environment, in
contrast with methods carried out in a laboratory setting or
at a time and place far-removed from the context of interest. This proximity
allows for greater ecological validity and reduced recall bias.
Moreover, EMA often takes advantage of other information sources, like
mobile sensors, that can sample the environment at the same
time as the assessment is performed and provide input into
models of the fine-scaled processes leading to the measured behavior[6][6], [7][7].
As a result, computerized task batteries designed with
computational modeling in mind are ideally suited for
EMA-style cognitive assessment.  

However, out of the existing selection of cognitive assessment batteries, ########################### REFINE - ARE THE BATTERIES LACKING, OR IS IT JUST THE PARTICULAR STYLE ABOVE THAT ARE FEW? BECAUSE THERE ARE LOTS OF EMA QUESTIONNAIRES. NOT SO MANY COMPUTERIZED TASK SETS I THINK... IN OTHER WORDS, THERE IS A SPECIFIC BIAS IN EMA TOWARDS SIMPLE, SHORT TESTS IN A SINGLE MODE, RATHER THAN COMPREHENSIVE BATTERIES.
many are not designed for use on mobile devices, or require administration
by a trained technician [5][5]. In almost all cases, they are not intentionally
set up for high levels of modularity, brevity, or ease-of-use. There is
therefore a need for task batteries that do possess these qualities
required for use in an EMA-style paradigm.  







Explain rational design here:

## Computational models


Simultaneous with the proliferation of EMA methods, there has recently been increased
exploration of approaches to cognitive assessment that take advantage of computational models.
Non-model-based analyses may venture post-hoc inferences about the factors that lead
to the observable outputs of cognitive processes, but a computational model actually
uses a mechanistic hypothesis as an investigatory tool in order to quantify latent
variables that underlie those outputs and predict future observations
ahead of time. If the performance of this simulated process (a mathematical formalism expressed in
computer code) matches that of actual human subjects when fed the same inputs, then the
hypothesis is considered a plausible explanation for how cognition operates in the real world.  

While methods that treat hidden cognitive processes as "black boxes" may
provide an objective bar for whether performance varies on some narrowly-defined
metric, they are comparatively poor at determining *why*. They are also poorly
generalizable; by collapsing all aspects of the task into a single dimension of
measurement, they implicitly make those particulars into preconditions
for future measurements, limiting the assessment's value for even slight
variations in context or mode of task performance.

In comparison, mechanistic computational models of cognitive processes, with 
cognitive tasks designed to dovetail with those models, offer a number of advantages:


 2. **They are explanatory.**
While methods that treat hidden cognitive processes
as "black boxes" may still provide an objective bar for whether performance varies
on some narrowly-defined metric, they are comparatively poor at determining *why*.
The parameters of a cognitive model, on the other hand, enable informed speculation
about the mechanistic causes of changes in performance because their fluctuations
can be identified with specific changes in the factors underlying that performance.
EXAMPLE

 1. **They are generative and predictive.** 
A cognitive model doesn't merely describe existing observations, but can generate
entirely new behavior. If stimuli are supplied to the model ahead of human
testing, this generated behavior serves as a prediction of how the subjects will
respond if their cognition operates according to the model's hypothesis.

They are generalizable
 3. **Model-based methods are more generalizable and extensible than alternatives.**
Because they offer a set of explicit internal parameters which are open to
manipulation, rather than a hidden set of assumptions which must be maintained to
preserve predictive validity, models can be much more flexibly tailored to approximate new situations
simply by adjusting those parameters. And in cases where the model is simply not flexible
enough to accomodate a novel situation, this very lack of flexibility often suggests
the most promising avenues for improving the the model.

 4. **Model-based methods offer increased accuracy.**
By treating accessory measurements as potential sources of mechanistic
constraint and gaining information from each individual trial rather
than only from multi-trial aggregates, a computational model can make
full use of available information that might otherwise be neglected or
underutilized. As a result, model-based assessments can be considerably
more accurate than the alternatives.

 5. **Model-based methods allow for estimation of uncertainty in performance.**
By running and rerunning a model on the same data set thousands of times, a distribution of
probable performances can be constructed, representing the expected variability in
a subject's performance. Observed variability can be interpreted in light of this
expectation, so that changes in performance can be identified as informative or simply
part of typical variation. 
ASK PER IF THIS IS CORRECT IN PARTICULARS AND CONSEQUENCES



In sum -
Improved specificity (what is going wrong under the surface)
Improved accuracy (how badly is it going wrong)
Beyond abstract improvements in understanding, the functional import of the above is more
accurate and more targeted interventions.









Cognitive assessments such as these simply aggregate performance
scores from a variety of tasks. The weighting of these scores in the final
metric is typically arbitrary. Moreover, many measurements which aren't
directly relevant to the chosen outcome, but which may still contain valuable
information about the processes which led to it, are neglected or underutilized.  



Going one step further, a computational model contains a set of variable
parameters whose values start off unknown, and which are then estimated through
a best-fit process against a subset of the data which the model is to
account for. These parameters are not just abstractions, but represent actual
aspects of the modeled process, and the best-fit values which are recovered for
them may therefore provide useful information about the modeled system.  









# Solution - the CogBat


## What the tasks are (why are we using these tasks in particular):

###: Based on well-validated standards
Validated standards which are amenable to computational modeling and which, in combination,
cover the constructs of interest (Cross-cognitive-domain sampling)

Focus: Overall focus on the meta-domain of "neurocapacity"
Domains: Attention. Perceptual decision. General decision. Reward learning. Working and long term memory.
Inventory control processes. Cognitive flexibility (task-switching). Inhibitory control.

They also feature potentially quick tasks


These have been used before - but previously they have not been modeled consistently, and rarely have they been integrated into a battery of complementary tasks.
Together and in this format, they count as a type of EMA.
