# Terminology

 - The [Cognitive Battery (or CogBat)][1] is a set of computerized tasks for the Android operating

# Required equipment and supplies

 - Asus ZenPad 8 tablet, model P00A, also known as 380M
 - USB Micro-B transfer cable.
 - [Crew Cognitive Battery .apk installer file][3]
 - [Continuous Recognition image set][4]
 - "Stay Alive! Keep screen awake" app for Android (author SyNetDev), available on
Google Play.  


# Methods and procedures

## Setup

Refer to the [main Cognitive Battery protocol][1] for the basic instructions on setting
up the CogBat on an Android tablet. 

One additional step is required for some ZenPads, which vary in the maximum time they
allow the screen to remain on without interaction before the device goes to sleep. The
Columbus Crew requires tablets to stay awake and ready to launch the CogBat for at least
10-20 minutes of idle time. *If you are not able to set the sleep time to longer than
5 minutes:*  

Download the "Stay Alive! Keep screen awake" app through Google Play and install it on
the tablet. Open the app and grant "App usage access" to Stay Alive! when prompted.
On the main Stay Alive! Options screen, set "Keep screen on while charging and on
battery". Select "Enable selected apps", "Keep screen on ONLY for selected apps", and
then under "Select apps that will Stay Alive!", choose the CogBat.
