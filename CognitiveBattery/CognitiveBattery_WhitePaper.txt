# Introduction

Over the past decade, cognitive science has thrust itself into the public
sphere in unprecedented ways, including the debut of a spate of commercial
tools that claim to assess or even augment different dimensions of human
cognition. Although both the theory and the efficacy of these products has
been called deeply into question, their very existence demonstrates that there is
a significant, unsatisfied appetite for concrete measures of cognitive functioning.
This may owe something to growing public awareness of the powerful developments
that have occurred in cognitive neuroscience over the last 10 to 15 years (cites?
BRAIN initiative, etc.?). Certainly at least some of this enthusiasm also
stems from the worries of an aging population that increasingly worries about
the impact that neurodegenerative disease may have on their future wellness. 

Whatever the reasons, this surge in attention on cognitive assessment has
unfolded simultaneously with two other transformative developments: first, a steady
increase in ubiquitious mobile computing power, which can be exploited to bring
assessments into the domain of everyday life; and second, the growth of the
field of cognitive modeling, which has the potential to magnify the power of
those assessments dramatically. There is now clear opportunity in the
development of computerized assessment
batteries that follow Ecological Momentary Assessment principles
(where the assessment is carried out very close to the context of
interest in both time and setting) and whose component tasks are either selected
for, or custom-built to dovetail with, computational cognitive models that can explain
the behaviors these tasks solicit in terms of deeper cognitive processes.

We recommend the Sederberg Cognitive Battery (SederBat),
a Python-based task battery which is readily deployed on the Android mobile
operating system, as embodying each of these criteria. The tasks in the
SederBat sample a broad set of
cognitive domains and are well-characterized by existing computational
models developed for this purpose, allowing users to properly quantify
uncertainty in performance measurements, determine whether apparent changes
in performance are real or artifactual, and hypothesize intelligently about
the parametric changes that led to actual changes. These benefits of
the SederBat ultimately facilitate more accurate and targeted cognitive interventions.




# Current approaches to cognitive assessment


## Research settings

The full constellation of cognitive assessments currently in use in academic and
clinical settings is too numerous to list, but a non-exhaustive selection of common paradigms
is listed in Table 1.  

Table 1

 - Grammatical, mathematical, and symbolic/logical reasoning
 - Reaction time
 - 2-choice decision making
 - Associative learning
 - Spatial and sequential working memory
 - Visual and verbal recognition memory
 - Matching grids and matching to sample
 - Sequence recognition
 - Multiple-choice decision making
 - Go/no-go tasks
 - Stroop-style tasks
 - Task-switching
 - Gambling tasks
 - Emotion-recognition tasks

In addition to individual use for answering focal questions, cognitive
assessments are now commonly grouped into batteries shaped for a specific purpose, such as
detection of cognitive decline [1][1] [2][2], drug state [3][3], attentional disorders, affective disorders,
OCD, schizophrenia, developmental disorders, neurodegenerative disease, cerebrovascular disorders,
and traumatic brain injury [4][4].

## Commercial offerings

Recently, a new set of assessment tools has become available as part of a wave of
commercial enthusiasm for what purports to be "brain training". The flagship firm in
this movement, Lumosity, at one time marketed its computerized games as both
diagnostic tools and interventions with power to augment cognition, even in cognitive
decline, but now (after controversy and an FTC settlement [8][8]) warns users that
they are "not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease"[9][9].
Nonetheless, the company still offers its product as a platform for research [10][10].
Lumosity is representative of the broader set of commercial offerings by groups like
CogniFit [11][11], CogMed[12][12], and Posit Science Corporation [13][13]. 
Common to most of these are a reliance on vague claims about neuroplasticity [14][14],
[15][15] despite a lack of evidence of far-transfer effects beyond the specific tasks
in the batteries themselves [16][16].


## Computerization and the ethos of Ecological Momentary Assessement

However, the lack of rigor in the popular/commercial sector should not be taken as
a general refutation of computerized cognitive assessments that are designed to be integrated into the
routine of everyday human life (just as the spurious claims of the herbal supplement
industry do not negate the immense utility of mainstream of pharmaceutical science).
On the contrary, this burgeoning genre of games highlights increasing readiness for the
development of "in-the-field" assessments with actual scientific merit that stems from
a philosophy of rational design and solid standards of validation.

Researchers in academic and clinical settings have already begun responding to this
call. The increasing ubiquity, affordability, and power of mobile devices 
in recent years has led to the massive expansion of methods following the ethos of
Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). 
The main advantage of EMA is direct access to an individual's
behavior and subjective self-reports *in the natural lived environment*, in
contrast with methods carried out at a time and place far-removed from the
context of interest, such as a laboratory setting weeks later. This proximity
allows for greater ecological validity and reduced recall bias.
Moreover, EMA often takes advantage of other information sources, like
mobile sensors, that can sample the environment at the same
time as the assessment is performed and provide input into
models of the fine-scaled processes leading to the measured behavior[6][6], [7][7].
As a result, computerized task batteries designed with
computational modeling in mind are ideally suited for
EMA-style cognitive assessment.  

However, out of the existing selection of cognitive assessment batteries,
many are not designed for use on mobile devices, or require administration
by a trained technician [5][5]. Of those that can be easily administered
through a mobile app, many are collections of subjective questionnaires. In
comparison, there are currently few arrays of behavior-mining tasks that sample
a broad and complementary set of cognitive dimensions while also being
set up for high levels of modularity, brevity, or ease-of-use. There is
therefore a need for task batteries that do possess these qualities
required for use in an EMA-style paradigm.  


## Computational models

Simultaneously with the proliferation of EMA methods, there has recently been increased
exploration of approaches to cognitive assessment that take advantage of computational models.
Non-model-based analyses may venture post-hoc inferences about the factors that lead
to the observable outputs of cognitive processes, but a computational model actually
uses a mechanistic hypothesis as an investigatory tool in order to quantify latent
variables that underlie those outputs and predict future observations
ahead of time. If the performance of this simulated process -- a mathematical formalism expressed in
computer code -- matches that of actual human subjects when both are fed the same inputs, then the
hypothesis is considered a plausible explanation for how cognition operates in the real world.  

In comparison to methods that treat hidden cognitive processes as "black
boxes", mechanistic computational models of cognitive processes offer a
number of advantages:


 1. **They are generative and predictive.** 
A cognitive model doesn't merely describe existing observations but can generate
entirely new behavior. If novel stimuli are supplied to the model, this
generated behavior predicts how human subjects will respond given the same
inputs.

 2. **They offer increased accuracy.**
Computational models are well suited to making full use of available information
that might otherwise be neglected or underutilized. They readily accept
information at the per-trial level, rather than in aggregates across many trials
that average out finer-scale variation. They can also be constrained with input
from other testing modalities such as fMRI or EEG through the process of
hierarchical, or joint, modeling [17][17], [18][18]. As a result of these
additional sources of informational leverage, model-based assessments may be
considerably more accurate than the alternatives.  

 3. **They allow for characterization of uncertainty in performance.**
By running and rerunning a computational model on the same data set thousands of
times, a distribution of probable performances can be constructed, representing the
expected variability in the performance of a real-world subject operating under
the model's asumptions. Observed variability can be interpreted in light of this
expectation, so that it can be determined whether changes in the cognitive
measurement are significant or merely part of expected variation. In contrast,
methods that treat cognitive processes as "black boxes" may also supply an
objective bar of whether performance varies, but are far more susceptible to
false-positives due to noise in the instrument itself.

 5. **They are explanatory.**
"Black box" methods are also comparatively poor at determining *why* changes
in performance occur even after those changes are firmly established.
The parameters of a cognitive model, on the other hand, enable informed speculation
about the mechanistic causes of changes in performance. Their fluctuations
(extracted by calculating the best-fit values to account for the observed data)
can be linked to specific changes in the factors of cognition. 


In sum, computational models offer more accuracy when it comes to describing
cognitive performance and determining whether that performance deviates
from expectations, plus much more specificity about *how* deviations are
produced when they do occur. More accurate and specific assessments, in
turn, facilitate more targeted interventions.



# The SederBat

Given these trends, we have become aware of the unsatisfied need for:
 1. a portable, computerized task battery suitable to EMA-style assessment,
 2. containing tasks for which there are established computational models, or that
are at least readily amenable to computational modeling.

In response, we have developed the Sederberg Cognitive Battery (SederBat), which
comprises both a task-set and accompanying computational models that are designed
to dovetail with those tasks. Both are implemented using the highly accessible Python
programming language, though the task set is available on mobile devices through
installers for the Android operating system. The cognitive tasks in the battery
have been selected to tap into as wide a variety of cognitive domains as possible,
but with a particular focus on those that factor into the "meta-domain" of
neurocapacity, which is a major topical focus in research on age- and trauma-related
cognitive decline, cognitive ergonomics, etc. 

Table 3
Some cognitive domains sampled in the SederBat:

 - Attention
 - Perceptual decision
 - General decision
 - Reward learning
 - Working memory
 - Long term memory
 - Inventory control processes
 - Cognitive flexibility (task-switching)
 - Inhibitory control

Neurocapacity is often conceptualized as a finite resource whose supply is constantly
in flux and which is required for
the operation of a host of critical cognitive processes. (CITE!) Better understanding of
how this resource is utilized and replenished would therefore be of immense value and
accessing it is one of the main design goals of the SederBat. However, because 
of the wide variety of cognitive domains thought to be involved in it, 
the battery will incidentally be well-equipped for many research focuses outside the
specific confines of neurocapacity.

The design of the Sederbat also aims to achieve this cross-cogntive-domain sampling through
a low number of total tasks (3 in the current implementation) that are also
relatively short in duration. This reduces task
burden on the subjects, making EMA-style assessments (where tasks may be
performed several times throughout the day and in a variety of different
environments) much more feasible. Therefore, we have focused on developing
multi-domain tasks that draw on a wide variety of cognitive processes
simultaneously, and on models that can extract maximal information from
individual trials rather than requiring very long, uninterrupted runs of
trials to work.

## Selection of tasks

These tasks are based on well-validated standards, modified to satisfy the
criteria described above:

 - **Flanker**
Based on the Eriksen Flanker task (CITE, 1974) of contextual inhibition.
Accesses: Attention, perceptual decision, general decision, inhibitory control
The subject's task is to indicate the direction of a central arrow, suppressing
prepotent reponses from flanking symbols that may be directionally congruent,
opposite, or neutral. Decision and response time data are collected.


 - **Moving Dot**
Based on the Random Dot Motion paradigm [19][19].
Accesses: Attention, perceptual decision, general decision, inhibitory control
The subject's task is to indicate the direction of the majority of dots in a
field of moving dots. This requires the extraction of the dominant directional
signal from irrelevant noise, with varying degrees of difficulty based on varying
degrees of coherence in the dot motion. Decision and response time data are collected.


 - **Continuous Recognition**
Based on the Continuous Recognition Memory task (Hannay & Levin, 1988)
Accesses: General decision, working memory, long term memory
The subject's task is to assign images to old or new categories based on
whether they have been experienced before, with varying lags between
repetitions in order to observe delay effects. The image sets also contain
task-irrelevant baits, such as images that come from the same semantic
category but are not identical. Decision and response time data are collected.


 - **O-BART (under development)**
Derived from Balloon Analogue Risk Task (CITE) with task-shifting elements
similar to Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (CITE 1948)
Accesses: General decision, reward learning, cognitive flexibility (task-switching)
The subject's task is to collect as much money as possible by pumping air into
a balloon which may or may not pop. This requires a trial-by-trial evaluation of
risk versus reward, as well as estimation of hidden risk and reward tendencies
from noisy processes, and occasional task-switching from positive reward trials to
negative pay-to-play trials. Decision and response time data are collected
alongside value, pump, risk, and other trial-level game state information.
