Lifelogging - Device Setup
--------------------------

Author: Michael Gravina  
Revision: 170920  
Effective date: 09/20/2017  


# Purpose

This protocol describes the setup of the Lifelogging wearable system prior to beginning
data collection on a subject.  


# Terminology

 - The Lifelogging device is a wearable phone that passively collects image, audio
(obfuscated), accelerometry, and GPS data during the wearer's everyday life. It also
provides a vehicle for deploying the Cognitive Battery, which requires the wearer to
periodically start an app and perform active cognitive tests.  

 - The Cognitive Battery (or CogBat) is a set of computerized tasks for the Android operating
system, running on the [SMILE experiment-writing library for Python][1]. 


# Assignment of responsibilities

A principal operator should be assigned to set up and manage the Lifelogging devices for
each given study group.

     - On the "Setup" tab:
         - `Accelerometer`, `GPS`, `Audio` and `Camera` should be On.
         - `Raw Audio` should be Off.
         - `Days to review` should be 1.
         - `Recording trigger` should be Time.

     - In "General Options", `Start on bootup` and `Start on app launch` should be
enabled.
     - In "Logging details", only `Log to CSV` should be enabled.
     - In "Auto send, email and upload":
         - `Allow auto sending` and `Send on Wi-Fi only` should be enabled.

             - `Target email addresses` should be OSUcompmem+subjXXX@gmail.com.
             - `Mail provider` should be Google Mail.
             - `Username` and `From Address` should be OSUcompmem@gmail.com

             - `Password` is the password for that GMail address.
             - `Server` is smtp.gmail.com.
             - `Port` is 465.

 - **CompMem Cognitive Battery app**
     - Refer to the Cognitive Battery Overview protocol for instructions for installing
the CogBat app.
     - Start the app and go to the subject ID screen. Enter the subject ID, and lock the
ID (this can be done from the "Settings" button menu). Proceed to the next screen, then
exit the app before beginning the tasks.

 - **MobiLock Pro**
     - The MobiLock website allows you to log in and manage device profiles which can be
assigned to multiple devices. We set up one device profile named "Standard".
         - On the "Edit Profile" screen for this profile, the Select Apps tab should show all
of the above apps and the Clock app as both `Enabled` and `Visible on homescreen`.
         - On the "Optional settings" screen, `Allow users to access 'Wifi Connection'
inside of app` and `Allow users to connect/disconnect from Wifi Network` should both be
enabled.
     - On the "Devices" screen of the website, an entry should exist for every phone, named
"Axe*XXX*" with XXX being the left-zero-padded phone number (i.e. 001, 002, etc.).
     - On each phone, enter the MobiLock Pro app and log in with the corresponding phone
ID.  

Operator_________ Date____ /____ /__________  

All of the apps above should be given full permissions. This can be accomplished by
going to the the Android Settings/Apps menu, selecting each of the apps above in the
menu, selecting "Permissions", and making sure that all of the listed permissions are
enabled.  

Operator_________ Date____ /____ /__________  


## Prep for deployment

When the phones are in the field, MobiLock Pro should be activated so that the subjects
are locked out of all but the chosen apps. If necessary, you will be able to make remote
changes to the MobiLock lockout settings through the online portal, as long as the
phones are connected to WiFi.
