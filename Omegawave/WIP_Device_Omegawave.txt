Omegawave:
Get Omegawave app (Angela will have the team login code) 
Record live datastreaming, so it can be played back later.
Get some dummy datasets

Bring in the info from device spreadsheet


Materials
Puck model OW-CB2
ECG chest strap
DC Potential cable
Pre-gelled electrodes for DC Potential
USB Micro-B charging cable

Make sure the sensor puck is charged by attaching it to a computer's USB port using the USB Micro-B charging cable for approximately 1 hour. Charge once weekly.

Setting up Omegawave account (using the provided team activation code).
Make sure that subject physical information is kept up to date - calculations depend on it.

Pairing sensor with mobile device - 
Open app and go to Settings
Sensor (OW-CB2) should be visible in the list. Select it to complete pairing.


Measurement conditions - 
Wait at least 30 minutes after exercise
Try and ensure consistent conditions each time.


ECG measurement - (cardiac and metabolic state)
Attach the puck to the chest strap (make sure the USB port is facing down). Soak the chest strap electrode pads (silver) with water. Put the strap on with the puck at the bottom of the sternum and the electrode pads aligned with the midaxillary line of the body [PICTURE], so that the strap is tight and does not move out of position during normal breathing. For female users, the strap should be directly below or under a sports bra support band.

DC Potential measurement - (CNS state)

Attach a new single-use, pre-gelled electrode to each terminal of the DC Potential cable. Place the terminal with the head icon in the center of the forehead, and the terminal with the hand icon on the palm of the dominant hand at the base of the thumb. Connect the cable to the puck using the USB port. Seal opened electrode pouches to prevent drying.

Follow this order to avoid damage/bending: Wet straps and wear strap. Attach electrodes. Attached cable to electrodes. Attach cable to puck. Attach puck to strap.

Wait until app detects sensor data.
Lay down and start measurement immediately by pressing "Measure" in the app, then when the button turns green, tap Start Measuring.

Relax and breathe normally. The measurement takes approximately 4 minutes.

When done (a sound will be emitted), remove sensor from strap before standing up, and then remove the cable from the sensor.

Tap "Save and analyze". The calculation will proceed and then present the results.

When finished, remove the sensor from the strap and the cable in order to prevent battery drain.



Analysis

Find Omegawave rep - is the data export API developed yet so we can download raw ECG and DC potential info?



Maintenance
Machine-wash the strap frequently (instructions on the strap)
Charging weekly
