Lifelogging - Subject Setup
---------------------------

Author: Michael Gravina  
Revision: 170920  
Effective date: 09/20/2017  


# Purpose

This protocol describes the setup of a human subject with the Lifelogging device for a
period of data collection and Cognitive Battery tasking.  


# Terminology

 - The Lifelogging device is a wearable phone that passively collects image, audio
(obfuscated), accelerometry, and GPS data during the wearer's everyday life. It also
provides a vehicle for deploying the Cognitive Battery, which requires the wearer to
periodically start an app and perform active cognitive tests.  

 - The Cognitive Battery (or CogBat) is a set of computerized tasks for the Android operating
system, running on the [SMILE experiment-writing library for Python][1]. 


# Assignment of responsibilities

A principal operator should be assigned to set up and manage the subjects for
each given study group.

## Personal tutorial

Turn the Lifelogging device on and give the subject a copy of the Participant
Instructions to keep. Go through the instructions with them, demonstrating how
to use the device, with particular focus on the following points:  

 - WiFi
     - How to set up WiFi
     - The importance of plugging in and connecting to Wifi each night
     - Shutting off WiFi each morning if possible to save battery power
 - How to turn recording on and off and how to block the camera
 - Basic privacy considerations
 - How and when to use the upload veto function
 - When and how to run the Cognitive Battery
     - They should set the Clock app alarm to the same time each day,
and try as much as possible to do the tasks near that time each day
     - Recommend a low-distraction environment
 - How to contact us  

Ask the subject to review the Participant Instructions again the day that they
begin data collection.


## Pouch setup

Each participant gets one pouch with a neck lanyard. You may have to adjust
the length of the cord so that the phone hangs comfortably. The phone should
point straight forward (rather than up as it may if it is resting too high
on the chest) and not hang so low that it swings back and forth or bounces
on the stomach when walking. For most subjects, a position in front of the
middle of the rib cage works well.

# When to begin
# Double-check data aquisition

## Smartphone setup
Set up the smartphone with the following settings:  

 - `Display` set to sleep after 5 minutes and set to stay in portrait view when the device
is rotated.
 - `Location` set to "High accuracy" mode.
 - `Google` account `lifelogging.osu@gmail.com`
 - `Date & time` set to automatic time and automatic time zone. When in Ohio, it should
automatically select "GMT-04:00 Eastern Daylight Time". Time should be in 12-hour time
format.
 - Bluetooth disabled.

## App setup

Install the following apps with the specified settings:

 - **Unforgettable.me**
     - Each phone should be set up with a different gmail account for Unforgettable.me,
with naming conventions as described in the *Required materials* section.
     - On the "Setup" tab:
         - `Accelerometer`, `GPS`, `Audio` and `Camera` should be On.
         - `Raw Audio` should be Off.
         - `Days to review` should be 1.
         - `Recording trigger` should be Time.
         - `Trigger interval` should be 30s.
         - `Autofocus` and `Notifications` should be Off.
     - Once these are set, the app should be locked by pressing the button on the
lower right corner of the "Login" tab. (To unlock the app, press the button again and
then enter the password through the standard password field.)

 - **GPSLogger**
     - In "General Options", `Start on bootup` and `Start on app launch` should be
enabled.
     - In "Logging details", only `Log to CSV` should be enabled.
     - In "Auto send, email and upload":
         - `Allow auto sending` and `Send on Wi-Fi only` should be enabled.
         - `How often?` should be set to 1440 minutes.
         - Scroll down and press `Email`.
             - `Allow auto sending` should be On.
             - `Target email addresses` should be OSUcompmem+subjXXX@gmail.com.
             - `Mail provider` should be Google Mail.
             - `Username` and `From Address` should be OSUcompmem@gmail.com
(without the subject ID)
             - `Password` is the password for that GMail address.
             - `Server` is smtp.gmail.com.
             - `Port` is 465.
             - `Use SSL?` is On.  

Operator_________ Date____ /____ /__________  

 - **CompMem Cognitive Battery app**
     - Refer to the Cognitive Battery Overview protocol for instructions for installing
the CogBat app.
     - Start the app and go to the subject ID screen. Enter the subject ID, and lock the
ID (this can be done from the "Settings" button menu). Proceed to the next screen, then
exit the app before beginning the tasks.  

Operator_________ Date____ /____ /__________  

 - **MobiLock Pro**
     - The MobiLock website allows you to log in and manage device profiles which can be
assigned to multiple devices. We set up one device profile named "Standard".
         - On the "Edit Profile" screen for this profile, the Select Apps tab should show all
of the above apps and the Clock app as both `Enabled` and `Visible on homescreen`.
         - On the "Optional settings" screen, `Allow users to access 'Wifi Connection'
inside of app` and `Allow users to connect/disconnect from Wifi Network` should both be
enabled.
     - On the "Devices" screen of the website, an entry should exist for every phone, named
"Axe*XXX*" with XXX being the left-zero-padded phone number (i.e. 001, 002, etc.).
     - On each phone, enter the MobiLock Pro app and log in with the corresponding phone
ID.  

Operator_________ Date____ /____ /__________  

All of the apps above should be given full permissions. This can be accomplished by
going to the the Android Settings/Apps menu, selecting each of the apps above in the
menu, selecting "Permissions", and making sure that all of the listed permissions are
enabled.  

Operator_________ Date____ /____ /__________  


## Prep for deployment

When the phones are in the field, MobiLock Pro should be activated so that the subjects
are locked out of all but the chosen apps. If necessary, you will be able to make remote
changes to the MobiLock lockout settings through the online portal, as long as the
phones are connected to WiFi.
