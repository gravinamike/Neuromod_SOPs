# Purpose

This protocol details the use of the Polar M430 smartwatch.

# Device features
[//]: # (What type of data does it collect?)

The Polar M430 features:

 - Heart rate monitor (continuous). 1s resolution. Accuracy is not outstanding
using native LED-wrist-bloodflow monitoring, but dramatically improves when
pairing watch with the Polar H10 chest strap.
 - GPS tracker (up to 30 continuous hours with 60s epochs in power-save Training
mode)
 - Actigraphy-based sleep monitoring (continuous). Accurate, but not nearly as
feature-rich as the Phillips Actiwatch.
 - Step counter (continuous)
 - Fitness coaching and workout-monitoring features  

Data output formats include:
 - All data can be visualized using the Polar Flow web app.
 - Heart rate data can be exported from Polar Flow web app in .CSV format.
 - GPS data can be exported from Polar Flow web app in .GPX format (basically .XML).

# Equipment and supplies

 - Polar M430 smartwatch
 - Supplied charging/data-transfer cable
 - Android smartphone
 - [Polar Flow web app and account][1]
 - Polar Flow Android app (available on Google Play)
 - [Polar FlowSync software][2]
 - Polar H10 heart monitor strap  


# Methods and procedures

## Setup

 - Download the Polar Flow app to your Android smartphone. Log in using your Polar account.
If you do not yet have an account, you may be prompted to create one.  
Download the Polar FlowSync software to your desktop computer and run the installer.
 - Connect the watch to the computer using the supplied charging/data-transfer cable. The
FlowSync software will notify you when the device has been synced to the software.
 - If the device has been used previously on another account, it will need to be reset to
factory settings. This can be done by going to the "Settings" screen (accessed through the
cog icon). *Caution: Factory reset will wipe all data off of the device.* After resetting
the watch, click "Sync" again and wait for the sync to finish.
 - **Pairing the watch with your phone:** *Please sync the watch with the Flow service
using a desktop computer as described above. The device may not register properly on the
phone if has not already been registered through the desktop.*  
On the Android phone, make sure Bluetooth is enabled. Open the Polar Flow app and login to
your account.
Go to "Devices" under the main menu. You should see "Got a new Polar device with mobile
setup?". On the watch, navigate (using the top and bottom right-side buttons) to "Settings",
"General settings", "Pair and sync", and "Pair and sync mobile device". Place the watch
so that it is touching the phone.

 - **Pairing the watch with heart monitor strap:**
You should be wearing the H10 heart monitor before attempting to pair it with the M430
smartwatch. (Alternately, you may be able to hold your fingers against the metal
contacts on the "puck" in order to fake the heart monitor into turning on long enough
to pair with the watch.)  
On the watch, navigate (using the top and bottom right-side buttons) to "Settings",
"General settings", "Pair and sync", and "Pair other device". Place the watch
so that it is close to the H10 puck and wait for the watch to confirm that they are
now paired.  
 - **Setting power-save GPS mode:**
On the watch, navigate (using the top and bottom right-side buttons) to "Settings",
"General settings", "Sport Profiles", "Other outdoor", and "GPS recording". ("Other
outdoor" is the sport profile we use for GPS tracking). Select "Power save, long
session" and press Select (the middle button on the right side). After the
confirmation messages are shown, press "back" to return to the main screen.  


## Wearing the device

The M430 should be worn on the non-dominant arm, behind the wristbone. Do not put the
watch over the wristbone or it will affect heart-rate acquisition. The watch can
remain on the wrist indefinitely, and can be worn safely while bathing or showering for
up to 30 minutes and to bed at night to monitor sleep.  


## GPS acquisition

Training mode must be active in order to acquire GPS. To enable training mode, make
sure you are starting on the Time screen (if not, press Back, the bottom-left button,
until you get there). Press the Select button (middle button on the right side of the
watch) once. Move up and down until you see "Other outdoor", and press Select again.
You may see a warning message, and then recording will begin.  
To deactivate GPS, hold the Back button. You will see a message counting
down and then training mode will be ended.  
Training mode can run up to 30 hours in power-save mode, during which time it acquires
GPS once every 60 seconds. However, you should charge and sync the phone at least
every 24 hours if GPS acquisition is going on nearly continuously. It is recommended
to activate training mode on waking up in the morning, then deactivate, plug in and
sync right before sleep.
