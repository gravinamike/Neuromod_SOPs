Lifelogging - Subject Setup
---------------------------

Author: Michael Gravina  
Revision: 170920  
Effective date: 09/20/2017  


# Purpose

This protocol describes the setup of a human subject with the Lifelogging device for a
period of data collection and Cognitive Battery tasking.  


# Terminology

 - The Lifelogging device is a wearable phone that passively collects image, audio
(obfuscated), accelerometry, and GPS data during the wearer's everyday life. It also
provides a vehicle for deploying the Cognitive Battery, which requires the wearer to
periodically start an app and perform active cognitive tests.  

 - The Cognitive Battery (or CogBat) is a set of computerized tasks for the Android operating
system, running on the [SMILE experiment-writing library for Python][1]. 


# Assignment of responsibilities

A principal operator should be assigned to set up and manage the subjects for
each given study group.

# Required materials

 - Consent materials
 - Lifelogging devices set up according to the Lifelogging Device Setup protocol
 - Lifelogging device pouches with neck straps
 - [Participant instructions][1]
 - Measuring tape with centimeter marks

# Methods and procedures


## Consenting and logging the subject

Consent the subject according to OSU SOPs. Record the assignment of device ID to
subject ID.

## Personal tutorial

Turn the Lifelogging device on and give the subject a copy of the Participant
Instructions to keep. Go through the instructions with them, demonstrating how
to use the device, with particular focus on the following points:  

 - WiFi
     - How to set up WiFi
     - The importance of plugging in and connecting to Wifi each night
     - Shutting off WiFi each morning if possible to save battery power
 - How to turn recording on and off and how to block the camera
 - Basic privacy considerations
 - How and when to use the upload veto function
 - When and how to run the Cognitive Battery
     - They should set the Clock app alarm to the same time each day,
and try as much as possible to do the tasks near that time each day
     - Recommend a low-distraction environment
 - How to contact us  

Ask the subject to review the Participant Instructions again the day that they
begin data collection.

Add instructions to Lifelogging setup to give subjects a CogBat demonstration and detailed instructions
Just make sure they know that have to respond while the image is still on the screen.
Start bringing a second, demo phone to show CogBat




## Pouch setup

Each participant gets one pouch with a neck lanyard. You may have to adjust
the length of the cord so that the phone hangs comfortably. The phone should
point straight forward (rather than up as it may if it is resting too high
on the chest) and not hang so low that it swings back and forth or bounces
on the stomach when walking. For most subjects, a position in front of the
middle of the rib cage works well.


## Head measurement
CCBBI pre-screening
Glasses prescription and PCP
Ask for phone numbers
Discuss schedule and availability for coming months
