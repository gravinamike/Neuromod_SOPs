Lifelogging - Data management
-----------------------------

Author: Michael Gravina  
Revision: 171212  
Effective date: 12/12/2017  



Curation - make sure you have all GPSLogger files!
When you recover the phone, just grab all the GPSLogger files at once.





# Purpose

This protocol describes the management of the Lifelogging experimental data after it has been
recovered from the Lifelogging devices and moved to the Borg server.



# Required equipment and supplies

 - Access to the Borg server



# Methods and procedures


## Archive structure  

The Lifelogging data is located under `cmlab/data/lifelog/Lifelog_2017/201706/`. *(This
is for the data associated with the subject group that started in June
2017. Subsequent groups should have their own subfolder named for the month
the group started.)*  

Data folders start with the subject ID (subjXXX format), with the type of data
appended after the name:  

**subjXXX: Unforgettable.me and GPSLogger data.**  
The finalized folder should contain:  
1. Approximately 21 files with YYYYMMDD.csv filename format. These are
the GPSLogger GPS files.  
2. A number of .csv files with long GUID-style filenames containing
the word "location". These are the U.me GPS files.  
3. Approximately 21 folders with YYYMMDD name format. These contain
the bulk of the U.me data, sorted by day.  
4. Approximately 21 folders with subjXXX_dayDD format. These are the
manually sorted image folders.  

**subjXXX_CogBat: The data from the Cognitive Battery which the subjects ran
once daily during collection.**  
The finalized folder should contain:  
1. Approximately 21 folders with YYYYMMDD_HHmmSS name format. These are
timestamped according to time of collection and contain the .slog files.  

**subjXXX_fMRI: The fMRI scan and task data.**  
The finalized folder should contain:  
1. 1 folder in XXXXPS name format. This contains the scan data.  
2. 1 folder in subjXXX_Relive format. This contains the slogs for the
"mentally reliving" SMILE task.  
3. 1 folder in subjXXX_RestingState format. This contains slogs for
the resting state (black screen) SMILE task.  

**subjXXX_EEG: The EEG trace and task data.**  
The finalized folder should contain:  
1. 12 EEG files: an .eeg, .vhdr, and .vmrk file each for task 1 (JoR),
task 2(Timeline), and then another set for the post-task 10-second capture
for each task.  
2. 1 folder in subjXXX_JoR name format, containing slogs for the JoR
SMILE task.  
3. 1 folder in subjXXX_Timeline name format, containing slogs for the
Timeline SMILE task.  

**"DEFUNCT"**:  
Note that Mike originally sorted the files according to their Zulu-timestamp.
However, that led to some files being mis-sorted to the wrong day. Since
then he corrected the sorting script to operate on Zulu-to-EST-converted
timestamps. This folder contains the original sorts, in case they are needed.  



## Subject metadata file  

Within the experimental archive there should also be maintained a file named
Lifelogging_subject_records.csv. This file should be kept current with de-identified
information for all subjects in the current group including:  

 - Subj ID
 - Collection notes
 - Collection dates
 - Device ID
 - CogBat notes
 - CCBBI ID
 - fMRI date
 - Scan protocols
 - fMRI notes
 - EEG date
 - EEG notes
 - JoR version (or version information for any other scripts if this varies within
the group.
