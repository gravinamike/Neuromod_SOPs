# Methods and procedures

Plug the phone in and let it charge to full. Check that it is connected to WiFi.
After some time has passed, verify that the
Play tab of the Unforgettable.me app does not say "UPLOADING" and the Review tab says
"There are no segments that need to be reviewed at this time". If either of these
conditions are not met, there is data still data from the app that needs to be
uploaded; leave the phone on power and WiFi until this is completed.

Once all data has been uploaded from the Unforgettable.me app, go to the Login tab.
Press the "UNLOCK" button and enter the password to unlock the app. Log out, then
log back in again. Confirm that all settings are correct, and press the "LOCK"
button to re-lock the app.


Connect the phone to your computer using the Micro-B USB cable. After a moment (and possible
setup dialog), you will see that the phone has appeared as a drive under File Manager.

Navigate to `Internal storage/SMILE/data/CognitiveBattery/`. You will see a folder for the
most recent subject (labeled with the subject ID). Verify that this folder contains
.slog files for each day of collection and copy the whole folder to your computer.

Navigate to `Internal storage/Android/data/com.mendhak.gpslogger/files/`. You will see all
of the .csv files that were collected by the GPSLogger app during the collection period
(one for each day). Copy all the .csv files to your computer.

Copy the data files to Borg

Delete everything



When you retrieve phones, make sure to offload all GPSLogger files manually to be sure:
While consolidating the archive, make sure that there is one GPSLogger .csv 
file (YYYYMMDD.csv filename format) for each of the 21 days of collection.
Occasionally these fail to
auto-send from the Lifelogging devices while they are in the field. If
a file is missing, it can usually be restored when the device is recovered
and stripped. The `Internal storage/Android/data/com.mendhak.gpslogger/files/` directory saves copies of
all GPSLogger files which should be removed from the on-device directory and
copied into the Borg directory (overwriting those that were sent during
collection).  





## Sub-heading

Equation:
$$ t_i = \rho t_{i-1} + t^{IN}, $$

Figure with a caption:
![*Example figure with caption.* Here is how to write a figure with a caption. You can insert multiple image types, including PNG and PDF. Figures will be inserted to fill the complete width of the page, though you can request a width as a percentage (see the end of the caption). The tag after the pound sign is key for referencing the figure in the text.](figs/example.png){#fig:example width=50%}
