Lifelogging data is under cmlab/data/lifelog/Lifelog_2017/201706/

Folders start with the subject ID (subjXXX), with the type of data appended:

*subjXXX: Unforgettable.me and GPSLogger data. *
The folder should contain:
1. Approximately 21 files with YYYYMMDD.csv filename format. These are the GPSLogger GPS files.
approximately 21 folders containing data by day.
2. A number of .csv files with long GUID-style filenames containing the word "location". These are the U.me GPS files.
3. Approximately 21 folders with YYYMMDD name format. These contain the bulk of the U.me data, sorted by day.
4. Approximately 21 folders with subjXXX_dayDD format. These are the manually sorted image folders.

*subjXXX_CogBat: The data from the Cognitive Battery that the subjects ran once daily during collection.*
The folder should contain:
1. Approximately 21 folders with YYYYMMDD_HHmmSS name format. These are timestamped according to time of collection and contain the slogs.

*subjXXX_fMRI: The fMRI scan and task data.*
The folder should contain:
1. 1 folder in XXXXPS name format. This contains the scan data.
2. 1 folder in subjXXX_Relive format. This contains the slogs for the "mentally reliving" SMILE task.
3. 1 folder in subjXXX_RestingState format. This contains slogs for the resting state (black screen) SMILE task.

*subjXXX_EEG: The EEG trace and task data.*
The folder should contain:
1. 12 EEG files: an .eeg, .vhdr, and .vmrk file each for task 1 (JoR), task 2(Timeline), and then another set for the post-task 10-second capture for each task.
2. 1 folder in subjXXX_JoR name format, containing slogs for the JoR SMILE task.
3. 1 folder in subjXXX_Timeline name format, containing slogs for the Timeline SMILE task.



"DEFUNCT": Note that I originally sorted the files according to their Zulu-timestamp. However, that led to some files being mis-sorted to the wrong day. Since then I have corrected the sorting script to operate on Zulu-to-EST-converted timestamps. I'm in the middle of re-sorting the archives. This should be done by Monday.

Figure with a caption:
![*Example figure with caption.* Here is how to write a figure with a caption. You can insert multiple image types, including PNG and PDF. Figures will be inserted to fill the complete width of the page, though you can request a width as a percentage (see the end of the caption). The tag after the pound sign is key for referencing the figure in the text.](figs/example.png){#fig:example width=50%}
