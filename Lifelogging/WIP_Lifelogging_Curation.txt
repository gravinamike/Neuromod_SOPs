Curation - make sure you have all GPSLogger files!
When you recover the phone, just grab all the GPSLogger files at once.





Curation scheme for image sets:
-------------------------------

<br>

 - **Common to all experiments:**
     - Verify that there is, natively, a uniform sampling across days in the archive (try and visualize the distribution of timestamps in Python)
     - Pick out as many distinct episodes from the morning and afternoon of each day for each subject. At least 30 per day, 15 in the morning and 15 in the afternoon.
     - Spatial distances should be sampled as much as possible, but we expect this to fall out pretty naturally if we ensure time is evenly sampled.
     - Try and balance features - people/nopeople, inside/outside. Time and space most important. Exclude:
Floors/ceilings/walls, Reflections of the subjects

     - Do not repeat photos
   

<br>

  - **Replication of PNAS paper:**
      - 21 days x 8 images per day (4 in the morning, 4 in the afternoon) = 168 images total
      - Randomize the images.
      - We do not want a time-block of time much greater than 7 minutes. Half a block of 84 images takes about 7.5 minutes. 4 time-blocks will exhaust all 168 images and take about 30 minutes.
      - **File structure:**<br>
        All image files should be collected into the same "images" folder within each SMILE experiment. This folder can be assembled from a folder structure of the sort used in Meredith's experiment (see below) using the  `grabImagesIntoOneFolder.py` script.
    - **File preprocessing:**<br>
        The `resizeImages.py` script should be used to resize all images to a standard height of 500 pixels (enter `python resizeImages.py folder` where `folder` is the directory containing all of the collected images for the experiment). Do this on the curated copies, NOT on the original images in the non-curated folders.

<br>

  - **Meredith's experiment:**
<br><br>
     - Select images to balance across the following bins:
         1. Which image is more recent (first or second image, 2 conditions)
         2. Gap between images (6 conditions), "logarithmically" spaced:
             - Within-morning/evening, between morning and evening, 1-2 days, 4-6 days, 8-12 days, 7 days (to explore cyclical patterns)
             - Max gap of half experimental duration to avoid compound with bin set #1
             - Includes at least a pair from each day to sample the supposed “temporal fovea”
         3. Recency of the most recent (proximal and distal, for 3 conditions)
            - Logarithmically spaced
<br><br>
    - The above will yield 36 different conditions (2 order x 6 gap x 3 recency). Include 2 of each condition in each block of 72 image pairs. At ~5s per trial/pair, that is 6 minutes per block. Running 4 blocks will take ~24 minutes.
    - In the event that subjects are missing data for specific days, images should be pulled evenly from the remaining days in order to make up for the shortfall.
    - **File structure:**<br>
        The curated image files should be sorted into folders by day (named in format 'subj00X_dayXX', where XX is the left-zero-padded day of the study, starting at 01), and within each day folder into subfolders named 'morning' and 'afternoon'.
    - **File preprocessing:**<br>
        The `resizeImages.py` script should be used to resize all images to a standard height of 500 pixels (enter `python resizeImages.py folder` where `folder` is the directory containing the 21 day-level folders). Do this on the curated copies, NOT on the original images in the non-curated folders.

Figure with a caption:
![*Example figure with caption.* Here is how to write a figure with a caption. You can insert multiple image types, including PNG and PDF. Figures will be inserted to fill the complete width of the page, though you can request a width as a percentage (see the end of the caption). The tag after the pound sign is key for referencing the figure in the text.](figs/example.png){#fig:example width=50%}
