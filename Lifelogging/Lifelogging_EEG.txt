Lifelogging - EEG experiments
-----------------------------

Revision: 171130

# Purpose

This protocol describes the preparation and execution of the EEG portion of the Lifelogging
study, comprising both the "Judgement of Recency" and "Timeline" experiments. These
Python/SMILE-based experiments present the subject with autobiographical images from their
own collection period and ask them to perform temporal judgements on the events those
images depict. They are designed to be run with simultaneous EEG collection.  


# Assignment of responsibilities

A primary operator should be assigned to run the EEG experiments for each subject.

# Required equipment and supplies

 - [SMILE experiment-writing library for Python][1]
 - [JoR Python script][2]
 - [Timeline Python script][3]
 - [print_last_trail Python script] [4]
 - Encrypted thumb drive for data transfer

# Methods and procedures

## Preparing for the experiment

The stimulus computer should be loaded up with the latest version of the JoR and
EEG Python scripts (copy the "JoR_v4" and "Timeline" folders over from the Git repository).
The subject's folder of 192 images curated by day of the study and half-day should be
copied into each of these 2 folders and renamed "images".  

On the stimulus computer, open 2 terminals and "cd" to the "JoR_v4" and the "Timeline"
directories. On both terminals, enter the command `python main.py -s subjXXX` where
XXX is the subject number, but do not hit Enter yet.  
*(If you have opportunity before the subject arrives, it is recommended to test-run
both scripts (as above,
but without the "-s subjXXX" subject ID parameter) for a few stimuli to ensure that
the provided stimuli work properly with the listgen scripts.)*  

Prepare for EEG according to the standard protocols for your EEG center.

## Running the experiment

Once the subject is prepped for EEG and sat in front of the stimulus computer,
inform them that they should wave at the camera if they have questions or are done
with the current section of the experiment, and ask them to keep movement to a
minimum. 
Hit enter on the JoR_v4 terminal. After the listgen finishes working, you will be
informed whether it was able to build a full stimulus set (84 image pairs in 4 blocks
of 21) and, if so, asked whether you want to proceed. Press "y" and Enter to continue.  
Review the instructions with the subject, ask if they have any questions, then ask
them to wait while you begin EEG recording. Tell them they can start as you close
the door. Watch for syncpulses and monitor the subject as they proceed with the
experiment.

After they have finished the JoR and you have collected the post-experiment 
EEG file, run the Timeline experiment (very similar to the above, though there will
not be a prompt to continue after the listgen).

Once the experiments are complete, clean up and break down according to the
standard protocols for your EEG center. Make note of any unusual events or
discrepancies in the participant and data logs for the experiment.

## Restarting an experiment mid-run

As much as possible, you should plan and prepare to run the experiment in a single,
continuous fashion. Interruptions are very problematic and risk inducing confounds
in the data. 
However, in the rare case where an unanticipated complication forces
you to interrupt the experiment during the execution of one of the Python scripts and
you will otherwise lose the subject data entirely, it is possible to abort and restart
the scripts, using the following procedure.  

 - Exit the script by pressing Alt+Tab (to switch from the SMILE display to the
terminal), then pressing Ctrl+C at the terminal. Note that you *must* exit using this
method to ensure that the current partial-run data is saved. Exiting using the "exit"
button on a window, the Task Manager, or any other method risks losing the data up
until the current point.  

 - Determine the last block and trial numbers the script completed.
The "print_last_trial.py" Python script can help with this. Copy the output file for the
experiment (in the "data" folder for the experiment, of the form "JoR_v4_X.slog" or 
"Timeline_v4_X.slog", where X is a number) into the folder with print_last_trial.py.
At a terminal for that folder, run this command:
`python print_last_trial.py [filename of the slog file]`.
The script will print out a number, which counts the number of trials that completely
finished. You will most likely have to do some math to figure out
the information you need, which is the block number and the trial number within that
block of the last-completed trial. Add 1 to the trial number you get to determine
the trial you want to restart at (and if the experiment was at the end of a block
when you aborted, add 1 to the block as well).  
*Note that this script does not refer to whatever trial was onscreen when the script
was aborted, but the one that finished right before it. It also refers
to the **absolute** trial number since the beginning of the script, **not** the trial
number within the run/block. Finally, the script only **counts** the trials, it does not
refer to any internal trial IDs of the experimental script, so if for some reason you
are running it on data that do not start from trial 1, the number will have to be
adjusted accordingly.*  

 - Open the experiment's "main.py" script using an editor like Atom, PsychoPy or
Notepad. Scroll down to the section with the comment "# Information for picking up a
run where it left off:". Change "continue_flag" to True from False, and change
starting_block and starting_trial from 1 to the number of the run/block and
within-block trial that you want to restart at. Save the script.  

 - Restart the experimental script as normal. Start-up events, such as instructions,
will replay as before, so instruct the subject to disregard them.
Once the trials begin, they will restart from the block and trial you specified.  

 - Note that the interruption happened, and at what block/trial, in the data logs.  

 - Remember to reset the script's values to their defaults before you run
another subject.  

 - Caution for analysis: The .slog data file from a restarted experiment may or
may not number the
trials correctly, depending on the script. Be ready to detect and correct for
any mis-numbering during analyses.  


# Data retrieval/archiving

After completion of the experiment, the EEG files should be downloaded from the
EEG computer and uploaded to the Borg server under a folder named "subjXXX_EEG".
The folders of .slog data files for the current subject should be downloaded
from the stimulus computer and uploaded to the Borg server as well. They should
be renamed to "subjXXX_JoR" and "subjXXX_Timeline" and placed into the
"subjXXX_EEG" folder with the EEG trace files.  

Subject data, including images, should be erased from the stimulus computer once
the data has been backed up to Borg. A password-protected USB drive should be
used for all transfers and should be cleared of data once the transfer is done.
