Lifelogging - Collection
------------------------

Author: Michael Gravina  
Revision: 171003  
Effective date: 10/03/2017  


# Purpose

This protocol describes what the Lifelogging operator(s) must do daily while data
collection is proceeding, after the subjects have been set up with the Lifelogging
devices and sent out into the field.  


# Assignment of responsibilities

A principal operator should be assigned to set up and manage the Lifelogging data for
each given study group.

Operator(s):

# Required equipment and supplies

 - Account information* for the master Lifelogging GMail account
(lifelogging.osu@gmail.com)
 - Account information* for the subject Lifelogging GMail accounts
(OSUcompmem+axe*XXX*@gmail.com, where XXX is the left-zero-padded phone number,
i.e. 001, 002, etc.)
 - Account information* for the Lifelogging MobiLock Pro account. (The lab has a
MobilLock Pro account with a yearly subscription fee and an online portal for 
remotely managing the settings of all the devices. The email for the account is 
lifelogging.osu@gmail.com.)  

\**Passwords can be obtained from the previous project manager (as of 2017, Mike Gravina,
gravina.2@osu.edu).*


# Schedule of repeating tasks

Each day while collection is proceeding:  

 - **Check the Lifelogging voicemail** for calls from participants. The voicemail can be
accessed by participants at (614) 344-1189 and goes to a Google Voice account under the
email address "lifelogging.osu@gmail.com" (you will receive a message at that address
when there is new voicemail).  
 
 - Also **check the email of the chief investigator**, which should have been listed in
the Participant Instructions that you handed out.  
 
 - Download the data (as described below).  


# Data retrieval

For each subject:  
 
 - Request the download from Unforgettable.me.
     - Go to the Unforgettable.me website and login using the account
"OSUcompmem+axeXXX@gmail.com", where XXX is the left-zero-padded device number.
     - In the search bar, enter the current month and year and push enter. Then
narrow the date range further using the date fields that appear and push enter. You
should now see records by hour for a few days. It is good to leave a little time-overlap
with previous data downloads (ideally 2 days) so that you do not miss downloading any
data that falls in between downloads.
     - Click the small button at the right of the search bar and select "Download".
A message should appear asking you to confirm the large download; say yes.  
If you have technical issues downloading the data, contact the Unforgettable.me crew:
Andrew Hide (andrew.hide@newcastle.edu.au) or Simon Dennis
(simon.dennis@newcastle.edu.au).  
 
 - After a half hour or so (per subject), download the data from the link that
is sent to the "OSUcompmem@gmail.com" account.
     - The email will be tagged by the account according to which subject number
the .tar archive is for. Make sure you keep the different subjects straight. Mixing
them up will result in combining the files from different subjects and this is
difficult to detect and a *grand* pain to fix. I recommend downloading them one at a
time and renaming the files immediately to "subjXXX.tar".
     - Extract the archive and rename the resulting directory "subjXXX_temp".  
 
 - Each day you should also download the ".csv" files from the GPSLogger app.
     - The logger app will auto-send a file around midnight when the device
is on wifi. This may be a zipfile containing a ".csv" and a ".gpx", or it may just
be an unzipped ".csv" file. In any case, the ".csv" file is what you want. If
there are multiple ".csv" files for the same subject and date, just take one
(occasionally the logger sends duplicate files).  


# Plan for electronic archiving

 - Open the folder on "BORG" called "cmlab/data/lifelog/Lifelog_2017/201706/"
(you can create new folders on this pattern for different years and experiments that
start on different months).  

 - Copy the "temp" folder into the folder.  

 - Copy the tarfile to the "tarfiles" subfolder.  

 - Open a terminal and run the archiveSort script: "python archiveSort.py
subjXXX_temp subjXXX False". This will copy all of the files from the temp directory
into the subject's directory, sorting them according to date. If the last parameter
is "False" it will simply skip duplicates (remember we took a little overlap time
when we downloaded the files); if the last parameter is "True" it will overwrite
duplicates. You should see at least some duplicates overwritten or skipped if you
downloaded with overlap time. If you don't, you may be copying the wrong files for
this subject!  

 - Repeat for all subjects.  

 - Delete the temp folders on "BORG" and all of the files from the
computer you originally downloaded to (be sure to delete them from the "Trash"
folder too).  

 - Put the GPSLogger ".csv" file for each subject (again, taking care not to mix
up different subjects) into the appropriate folder subject's folder on "BORG"
("cmlab/data/lifelog/Lifelog_20XX/20XXXX/subjXXX"). You do not need to (and should
not!) sort the ".csv"s into the by-date folders. Downstream analyses will assume
that these ".csv"s are in the root folder for the subject, alongside the ".csv"s
generated by Unforgettable.me.
