Lifelogging - Subject Setup
---------------------------

Author: Michael Gravina  
Revision: 180102  
Effective date: 01/02/2018  


# Purpose

This protocol describes the setup of a human subject with the Lifelogging device for a
period of data collection and Cognitive Battery tasking.  


# Terminology

 - The Lifelogging device is a wearable phone that passively collects image, audio
(obfuscated), accelerometry, and GPS data during the wearer's everyday life. It also
provides a vehicle for deploying the Cognitive Battery, which requires the wearer to
periodically start an app and perform active cognitive tests.  

 - The Cognitive Battery (or CogBat) is a set of computerized tasks for the Android operating
system, running on the [SMILE experiment-writing library for Python][1]. 


# Assignment of responsibilities

A principal operator should be assigned to set up and manage the subjects for
each given study group.

# Methods and procedures


## Consenting and logging the subject

Consent the subject according to OSU SOPs.  

*Note: The current PI on IRB #2009B0093 is Brandon Turner. Supply the subject with this

## Personal tutorial

Turn the Lifelogging device on and give the subject a copy of the Participant
Instructions to keep. Go through the Participant Instructions with them, demonstrating how
to use the device, with particular focus on the following points:  

 - WiFi
     - How to set up WiFi
     - The importance of plugging in and connecting to Wifi each night
 - How to turn recording on and off and how to block the camera  
 - Basic privacy considerations  
 - How and when to use the upload veto function  
 - When and how to run the Cognitive Battery
     - It is advisable to bring a second device for demonstrating the
Cognitive Battery without creating "fake" CogBat files on the subject's
own device
     - Lead them through the first load-up, to the instruction screens,
but allow them to use the in-task demos to learn the tasks themselves
     - They should set the Clock app alarm to the same time each day,
and try as much as possible to do the tasks near that time each day
     - Recommend a low-distraction environment
     - Ask them to run through the tasks to the end (after the final
screen) each time, and not quit out early  
 - How to contact us  

Ask the subject to review the Participant Instructions again on the day that they
actually begin data collection.


## Pouch setup  

Each participant gets one pouch with a neck lanyard. You may have to adjust
the length of the cord so that the phone hangs comfortably. The phone should
point straight forward (rather than up as it may if it is resting too high
on the chest) and not hang so low that it swings back and forth or bounces
on the stomach when walking. For most subjects, a position in front of the
middle of the rib cage works well.


## Exchange information with subject  

 - **Contact information**<br> Ask the subject if they would supply a
phone number and an email address at which they can be contacted for
study purposes. Record this contact info below.  

Email___________________________ Phone number_________________________

 - **Head circumference**<br> Using the tape measure, record the subject's
head circumference. Place the
metal end in the center of the subject's forehead. Wrap the tape snugly around
the cranium, just above the ears and touching the occipital bone in back.
Take the measurement in centimeters where the tape overlaps in front. Remove
the tape and repeat the process once more to double-check the measurement.
Record this info so that the EEG operator can use it for setup in the future.

 - **fMRI info**<br>
Provide the subject with a link to the scan center's fMRI screening form
and ask them to review it for any contraindications to scanning. Note
that this is not the actual pre-screening and no form should be collected;
this is only to bring possible contraindications to attention ahead of
time.<br>
If the subject wears
glasses, notify them that this information will be needed before fMRI in
order to assemble the appropriate fMRI-safe glasses. Alternately, they may
wear contact lenses if they have them.<br>
Also notify them that they will
need to have ready the contact information of the Primary Care Physician that
they are currently seeing on the day of fMRI or before. (If they are not
currently seeing a Primary Care Physician, they may get one before the date
of the scan. Emphasize that it is imperative that they have a medical
practitioner that they are actively seeing who can receive a copy of
their scan information for review, since this is considered personal health
information. Without this condition met, we will not be able to conduct
the scan.)  

Operator_________ Date____ /____ /__________  

 - **Scheduling**
Discuss availability with the subject for the coming month or two, and
plan out a schedule for each phase of the experiment, including:  

    - Collection and Cognitive Battery: This phase currently
spans 3 calendar weeks, starting on a Sunday and ending on the Saturday
21 days later.  The subject should be able to wear the device and
perform the tasks for at least 8 hours (though more is better!) and
have access to electricity and WiFi on the majority of the days during
the period. The subject should also remain within the state during
collection. A day or two of non-collection is acceptable, but
if the subject anticipates much longer stretches where they will be
unable to collect, the collection period should be moved back as 
neccessary to a period with fewer conflicts.<br>
After setup, the subject should be instructed to take the phone
home and keep it powered off until actual collection begins.  

    - fMRI sensing: This will require at least 2 hours of in-person
time at the OSU facility within business hours. It should ideally
take place in the second week after the end of collection (so
there is approximately 1 week of "wait time" in between).  

    - EEG sensing: This will require at least 2 hours of in-person
time at the OSU facility within business hours. It should ideally
take place as close to 1 week after the fMRI sensing session as
possible.  

The exact scheduling of the two sensing sessions can be left open
intially, so long as the subject identifies appropriate periods
in which they anticipate no conflicts that would prevent them
from coming in for the sessions. When about 2 weeks remain in the
collection period, the subject should be queried
for concrete availability and appointments made with the fMRI
and EEG facilities.
