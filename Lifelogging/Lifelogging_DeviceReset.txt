Lifelogging - Device recovery and reset
---------------------------------------

# Purpose

This protocol describes the final recovery of data from the Lifelogging devices after the
collection period, followed by the resetting of the devices so that they can be
stored and later reassigned to new subjects.  

While a large amount of data is transmitted remotely while the device still is out in the
field, copies of much of this data persist on the device and must be stripped off manually
once the device is brought back into the lab. This is also an opportunity to double-check
for data that was not sent remotely for whatever reason, and to recover data of certain
types (like CogBat .slog files) that are never sent remotely.  


# Assignment of responsibilities

A primary operator should be assigned to recover and reset each device after a session
in the field.  

Operator(s):  
Name______________________________ Init______   Name______________________________ Init______  

Record the device ID, subject ID and operator recovering and resetting the device:  

|**Subject ID** |**Device ID** |**Operator** | |**Subject ID** |**Device ID** |**Operator** |

# Methods and procedures

Plug the phone in and let it charge to full. Check that it is connected to WiFi.
Make sure that the Unforgettable.me and GPSLogger apps are both not recording.  


## Clearing Unforgettable.me and changing passwords

After some time has passed on power and WiFi, verify that the
Play tab of the Unforgettable.me app does not say "UPLOADING" and the Review tab says
"There are no segments that need to be reviewed at this time". If either of these
conditions are not met, there is data still data from the app that needs to be
uploaded; leave the phone on power and WiFi until this is completed.  

Once all data has been uploaded from the Unforgettable.me app, go to the Login tab.
Press the "UNLOCK" button and enter the password to unlock the app. Log out.

The password for each device should be reset between uses by contacting the
Unforgettable.me team (Ben Stone benjamin.stone@gmail.com,
Andrew Hide andrew.hide@newcastle.edu.au, or Simon Dennis simon.dennis@gmail.com)
and requesting it.  

Once you have set a new password (and stored it securely), log back in again.
Confirm that all settings are correct, and press the "LOCK"
button to re-lock the app.  


## Blanking CogBat subject ID and WiFi connections

Go to the Cognitive Battery app. After the subject ID screen loads, enter "Settings",
turn off "Lock subject ID", clear out the subject ID from the text field, and
proceed to the next screen. Then exit the app before continuing to the battery. This
will blank out the subject ID field for future uses, ensuring that no files are
accidentally saved under an old subject ID.  

Go to WiFi connection settings and "Forget" every network that is listed. This will
prevent password conflicts or unwanted network access the next time the phone is
used.  


## Offloading files

Connect the phone to your computer using the Micro-B USB cable. After a moment (and possible
setup dialog), you will see that the phone has appeared as a drive under File Manager.  

Navigate to `Internal storage/SMILE/data/CognitiveBattery/`. You will see a folder for the
most recent subject (labeled with the subject ID). Verify that this folder contains
.slog files for each day of collection and copy the whole folder to your computer.  

Navigate to `Internal storage/Android/data/com.mendhak.gpslogger/files/`. You will see all
of the .csv files that were collected by the GPSLogger app during the collection period
(one for each day). Copy all the .csv files to your computer.  

Copy all of the CogBat and GPSLogger files to the Borg server, placing the files into the
proper location according to the *Lifelogging - Data Management* protocol.
*In particular, make sure that there is one GPSLogger .csv 
file (YYYYMMDD.csv filename format) for each of the 21 days of collection.
Occasionally these fail to auto-send from the Lifelogging devices while they are in the
field. If a file is missing, it can usually be restored when the device is recovered
and stripped by overwriting the .csv files that were sent remotely with those pulled
directly from the device.*  

Delete all copies of all Lifelogging data files from both the phone itself and the
computer used as an intermediate for transfer (including clearing them from the
Recycle Bin after they have been deleted.  


## Storage

After the Lifelogging device has been completely stripped, power it down until it
is to be prepped for the next use.
