# Purpose

This protocol describes practices for curating the Lifelogging data after it has been
collected and archived. The purpose of curation is to select a set of stimuli for 
the Lifelogging experiments from the un-curated archive.  


# Assignment of responsibilities

A principal operator should be assigned to set up and manage the Lifelogging data for
each given study group.

# Required training and supplies

 - Prior to beginning curation, the operator should familiarize themselves with the final
archive structure prescribed in the *Lifelogging - Data Management* protocol.  
 - Access to the Borg server  


# Methods and procedures

## Curation scheme for image sets

 - Verify that there is, natively, a uniform sampling across the days of collection in the archive.
It is expected that a day or two may be omitted for subject-specific reasons, and some days may have
sparser data than others. However, if there are long runs of days with no data or many half-days with
very little data, this should be noted in the study record and consideration of these irregularities
should be made when constructing the curated stimuli set (see below).  
<br>
 - Set up the folders for the curated image set. For the current experimental design, the curated
folder structure for each subject should contain:
    - 21 day folders, named in format 'subj00X_dayXX', where XX is the left-zero-padded day of
the study, starting at 01
    - 2 half-day folders per day, named 'morning' and 'afternoon'
    - 192 images total, (meaning that most half-day folders will contain 4-5 images)  
<br>
 - Now start copying (not moving) image files from the dated archive folders into the curated
folder structure.  
<br>
 - Exclude:
    - Any image which is too dark or blurry to clearly identify.  
    - Uninteresting images taken right up against walls, ceilings, floors, etc.  
    - Reflections of the subjects themselves.   
<br>
 - Try to pick out as many distinct episodes in each basic time unit (a half-day by default) as
possible.  
    - **The definition of an "episode"** will be somewhat arbitrary. An easy case would be a subject who
travels regularly between clearly different locations to do markedly different things; a hard
case would be a subject who stays in one place for the majority of the time, who spends long
periods doing the same thing (such as using computers or mobile phones), or who constantly
travels without stopping.
In these harder cases, episodes can be defined by transitions to new activities, a shift of
the people the subject is interacting with, movements between smaller sub-sections of the same
setting, etc.  
    - **Try to select episodes fairly evenly across time and space, and features**. If there is a very
rich interval at the beginning of a time period, you may be tempted to get all the episodes you need from
that interval and neglect the rest of the period. Avoid this if possible, and select at least some
episodes from later in the period. By the same token, if a single spatial setting dominates a time
period, try to include at least a few other locations if possible rather than taking all episodes from
that one setting. By a similar token, if there are a mix of indoor and outdoor scenes or scenes with
and without people, try and include at least some representation of each.  
    - **Exercise judgement** in all of this. Try to follow the guidelines above to the best of
your ability, but when in doubt, it's better to err on the side of ommission. For some very short
or uniform time periods, you may just have to accept a less-than-desired number of episodes or
even none at all. Don't duplicate obviously alike images just to "fill out" the number of episodes
in a given time period or create even coverage where none really exists.    
When a fixed number of episodes are called for in the experimental design, you can correct for such gaps
by selecting a number of extra episodes equal to the shortfall, evenly distributed across the other
time-periods. For instance, for a subject with good data on most days but 2 days with no usable episodes,
and a requirement to try to pick 5 episodes each day, you would choose no episodes from those 2 days
and spread an additional 10 episodes as evenly as possible across the remaining days.
